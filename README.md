This repository is for practicing data structs & algorithms for interviews. Also includes graphing of basic times of certain sorts.
Current status: just need to compile TabbedPane.java (javac graph/TabbedPane.java), and C output can be piped into that class with clang test.c && java graph/TabbedPane $(./a.out)
